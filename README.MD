# Nephelios: Rust-Based Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) Agent

Welcome to the **Nephelios** repository! This project is the core of our open-source Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution, designed to streamline cloud application deployment and management. Built with Rust, Nephelios offers a robust and efficient backend to support your applications seamlessly.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Effortless Application Deployment**: Deploy your applications to the cloud with minimal configuration, allowing you to focus on development rather than infrastructure.

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track resource consumption and application performance in real-time, providing you with valuable insights and control.

- **Scalability**: Easily scale your applications to meet demand without manual intervention.

- **Secure Environment**: Benefit from built-in security features ensuring your applications run safely in the cloud.

- **Docker Integration**: Fully containerized solution with Docker and Docker Compose support for easy deployment and scaling.

- **Service Orchestration**: Integrated with Docker Swarm for container orchestration and service management.

- **Reverse Proxy & SSL**: Built-in Traefik integration for automatic routing and SSL certificate management.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

You can run Nephelios either directly or using Docker Compose:

### Standard Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nephelios/nephelios.git
   cd nephelios
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed. Then, build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

3. **Configure the Environment**:
   Copy the example environment file and adjust configurations as needed:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run the Agent**:
   Start the Nephelios agent:
   ```bash
   cargo run --release
   ```

### Docker Compose Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nephelios/nephelios.git
   cd nephelios
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Start with Docker Compose**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   This will build and start the Nephelios service with all required configurations.

## 🛠️ Docker & Orchestration

Nephelios uses Docker and Docker Compose for containerization and orchestration:

### Docker Setup

The project includes a multi-stage Dockerfile that:
1. Builds the Rust application in a builder stage
2. Creates a minimal runtime image with only necessary dependencies
3. Includes Docker CLI for container management

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file provides a simple way to run Nephelios locally with all required configurations and volume mounts.

### Service Orchestration

The `nephelios.yml` configuration defines a complete service stack including:

- **Registry**: Private Docker registry for application images
- **Traefik**: Edge router for service discovery and SSL termination
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Metrics visualization and dashboards
- **Nephelios Frontend**: User interface for the PaaS platform
